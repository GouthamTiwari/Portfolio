Summary
I am an Operations & Supply Chain Leader with 8+ years of experience driving e-commerce growth, marketplace excellence, and operational resilience across KSA, MENA, Europe, and global markets. At Amazon, I've led large-scale operations, supply chain programs, and marketplace initiatives that improve seller success while protecting revenue in high-SLA environments.

My work focuses on merchant success and proactive incident management. I specialize in identifying early risk signals across catalog, pricing, inventory, and fulfillment, intervening before issues escalate into customer impact or multi-million-dollar vendor losses, especially during Ramadan, white friday sales, prime day and large launches.

Key impact:

1. $5.18M+ in direct revenue protection and $31M+ in potential losses prevented across $1B+ portfolios
2. $6.3M annual reduction in excess and aging inventory
3. 18,000+ operational hours saved annually through automation and process optimization
4. 99.8-99.89%+ SLA compliance across vendors, sellers, and fulfillment operations
5. 40-48% reduction in incident resolution times
6. 60-100 bps improvement in catalog accuracy, availability, and inventory health
7. 52+ enterprise vendors onboarded and scaled across KSA, MENA, and EU




I've led automation and digital enablement initiatives to simplify seller experience, including:

1. Intelligent Assistant built with Python, reducing ticket SLAs from 9+ to 5 business days
2. Automation tools saving 800+ hours annually
3. Large-scale catalog correction and compliance programs across KSA, UAE, Egypt, and Europe

I've also led and developed global teams of 38+, sustaining 99.89%+ performance while mentoring future leaders in analytics, escalation, and operations management. My leadership style blends ownership, data-driven decision-making, and collaboration to deliver outcomes that are both operationally efficient and merchant-centric.

I'm passionate about building scalable systems that empower sellers, strengthen supply chains, and drive sustainable e-commerce growth.
